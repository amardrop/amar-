    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, memory management is handled automatically by the interpreter using a technique known as dynamic memory allocation. When a Python object is created, it is given a unique identifier as well as a memory location. The interpreter then keeps track of the object's reference count, or the number of times the object is mentioned in the programme. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, the interpreter automatically frees the memory associated with that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a garbage collector, which is a background process that checks for and removes unreferenced objects from memory on a regular basis. This process ensures that no memory is wasted by unused objects, making Python an efficient and effective memory management language."

    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, indentation is required. Python uses indentation to define the scope and hierarchy of the code, as opposed to other programming languages that use braces to indicate blocks of code. This means that the way you indent your code has a direct impact on how it is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements indented at the same level in Python are considered to be part of the same block of code, and the indentation level determines the scope of the code. This is important for control structures like loops and conditional statements, where the indentation level defines the loop or condition's body."
